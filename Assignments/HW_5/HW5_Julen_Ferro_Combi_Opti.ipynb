    "1. Start with an initial flow x = 0.\n",
    "2. While there exists an augmenting path P in the residual graph G_x, do the following:\n",
    "   a. Find the minimum capacity of the edges and nodes along P:\n",

Then, create one additional edge from $v_in$ to $v_out$ with capacity $c_v$ (the capacity of vertex v).\n",

    "To show that there exists a polynomial algorithm for finding flows in an undirected graph, we'll first convert the undirected graph to a directed graph and then solve the maximum flow problem using a polynomial-time algorithm such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.\n",

    "In order to understand this first step, we will explain the main difference between Directed and Undirected graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directed Graphs:** In a directed graph (also known as a digraph), each edge has an initial node (tail) and a terminal node (head). The flow in a directed graph can only be sent in the direction specified by the edge, from the tail to the head. This means that the flow along an edge (u, v) can only go from node u to node v, and the direction of flow is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undirected Graphs:** In an undirected graph, the edges do not have an inherent direction. The flow can be sent along an edge in either direction between the connected nodes. This means that the flow along an edge (u, v) can go from node u to node v, and from node v to node u. The direction of flow is not significant, and the flow can be reversed without changing the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a flow problem in an undirected graph, it is common to convert it into a directed graph, as described in the first paragraph for this specific problem. This is done by replacing each undirected edge with two directed edges in the opposite direction, each with the same capacity as the original undirected edge. After finding the maximum flow in the directed graph, it can be converted back to a flow in the original undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with capacities on the edges, we can create a directed graph G' = (V, E') as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each undirected edge (u, v) ∈ E with capacity c(u, v), add two directed edges (u, v) and (v, u) in E', both with capacity c(u, v).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a directed graph G', we can apply a polynomial-time algorithm to find the maximum flow, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses the shortest path in the residual graph (with respect to the number of edges) as the augmenting path. The running time of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O(VE^2), which is polynomial in the number of vertices V and edges E.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've found the maximum flow in the directed graph G', we can convert it back to a flow in the original undirected graph G. For each undirected edge (u, v) ∈ E, the flow value f(u, v) in G is equal to the flow value f'(u, v) - f'(v, u) in G' (the difference in flows in the corresponding directed edges). This way, we finally set the direction of each edge, thereby converting the undirected graph in a directed one with defined directions for each edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we've shown that by converting the undirected graph to a directed graph and using a polynomial-time algorithm like Edmonds-Karp, we can find the maximum flow in an undirected graph in polynomial time."

    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a given matching $M$, we can construct an edge cover $D$ by taking the edges in $M$ and adding an arbitrary edge that is incident to each unmatched node. Since each edge in $M$ covers two nodes and there are $|V| - 2|M|$ unmatched nodes, the size of $`D`$ is $`|M| + (|V| - 2|M|) = |V| - |M|`$.\n",

We can partition the edges in $`D`$ into two sets: the set of edges that are part of a matching $`M'`$ (not necessarily maximum) and the remaining edges that are not part of any matching. For each edge in $`D`$ that is not in $`M'`$, at least one of its endpoints is not covered by $`M'`$. Therefore, the number of nodes not covered by $`M'`$ is at least the number of edges in $`D`$ that are not in $`M'`$. Since each edge in $`M'`$ covers two nodes, the total number of nodes covered by $`D`$ is at least $`2|M'| + (|D| - |M'|) = |V|`$. Therefore, $`|D| >= |V| - |M'|`$.\n",

    "3. Combining the observations from (1) and (2), we have $`|D| = |V| - |M|`$ and $`|D| >= |V| - |M'|`$, where $`M`$ is a maximum matching and $`M'`$ is an arbitrary matching. This implies that $`|M| >= |M'|`$, which means that $`M`$ is a maximum matching, and thus the minimum cardinality edge cover has size $`|V| - |M|`$.\n"
