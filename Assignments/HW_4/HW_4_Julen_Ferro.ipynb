    "To prove that only an empty arc can become inadmissible after modification of the dual variables in the primal-dual solution of the Hitchcock transportation problem, we'll first define the problem and the primal-dual method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Hitchcock transportation problem (trans-shipment problem) is a classical optimization problem that involves minimizing the cost of shipping goods from multiple origins to multiple destinations while satisfying supply and demand constraints. The problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem with primal variables representing the flow on each arc (origin-destination pair) and dual variables associated with supply and demand constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The primal-dual method is an iterative technique used to solve linear programming problems. It involves updating the primal variables (flows) and dual variables (shadow prices) in each iteration to approach the optimal solution. The primal variables are updated by finding a feasible direction that reduces the objective function, while the dual variables are updated to maintain complementary slackness and feasibility of the dual problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's prove that only an empty arc can become inadmissible after modification of the dual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let (i, j) be an arc in the transportation network, and let x_ij be the flow on this arc, c_ij be the cost per unit flow, and u_i and v_j be the dual variables associated with supply at node i and demand at node j, respectively. An arc (i, j) is admissible if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "c_ij - u_i - v_j = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider modifying the dual variables u_i and v_j. Without loss of generality, suppose that u_i increases by some amount Δu_i and v_j decreases by the same amount Δu_i to maintain feasibility of the dual problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "u_i' = u_i + Δu_i,\n",
    "v_j' = v_j - Δu_i.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new reduced cost for arc (i, j) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "c_ij - u_i' - v_j' = c_ij - (u_i + Δu_i) - (v_j - Δu_i) = c_ij - u_i - v_j + 2Δu_i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the arc (i, j) is empty (x_ij = 0), then the reduced cost may become positive, i.e., inadmissible, after modifying the dual variables.\n",
    "- If the arc (i, j) is non-empty (x_ij > 0), then the reduced cost remains non-positive, i.e., admissible, since the primal-dual method ensures that non-empty arcs have non-positive reduced costs to maintain complementary slackness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, only an empty arc can become inadmissible after modification of the dual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple transportation problem with two origins (O1, O2), two destinations (D1, D2), and unit shipping costs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "O1 -> D1: 1\n",
    "O1 -> D2: 2\n",
    "O2 -> D1: 3\n",
    "O2 -> D2: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the initial dual variables are u_O1 = 0, u_O2 = 0, v_D1 = 1, and v_D2 = 2. Then, the reduced costs for all arcs are non-positive, and the solution is admissible. Now, let's increase u_O1 by 1 and decrease v_D1 by 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "u_O1' = 1,\n",
    "v_D1' = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new reduced costs after updating the dual variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "O1 -> D1: 1 - 1 - 0 = 0 (admissible)\n",
    "O1 -> D2: 2 - 1 - 2 = -1 (admissible)\n",
    "O2 -> D1: 3 - 0 - 0 = 3 (inadmissible)\n",
    "O2 -> D2: 4 - 0 - 2 = 2 (admissible)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the arc (O2 -> D1) becomes inadmissible after modifying the dual variables.

    "\n",
    "Now, let's analyze the complexity of the Blossom Algorithm on general graphs:      \n",
    "    The algorithm begins by initializing a forest structure with unmatched vertices as roots, taking O(n) time.\n",
