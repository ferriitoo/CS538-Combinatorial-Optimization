# ***_COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION_*** 🛠️

This repository contains the Homework assignments and experiments carried out for the Combinatorial Optimization subject, at Illinois Institute of Technology for the Master´s degree in Computational Decision Science & Operations Research.

This subject provides its students with a solid understanding on Linear Optimization concepts and Optimization algorithms like Network Flows, Minimum-cost network flows, Hungarian Method, Simplex Methods... to be mainly used in the Operations Research field:
