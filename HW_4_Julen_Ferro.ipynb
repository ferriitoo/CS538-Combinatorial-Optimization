    "(i) In the context of the Hitchcock problem (also known as the transportation problem), an arc (i, j) is called inadmissible if its reduced cost is negative. The reduced cost is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "r(i, j) = c(i, j) - u(i) - v(j)\n",

    "where c(i, j) is the transportation cost from supply node i to demand node j, and u(i) and v(j) are the dual variables associated with node i and node j, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the primal-dual algorithm aims to find a feasible solution that satisfies complementary slackness conditions. At each iteration, the algorithm adjusts the dual variables to make inadmissible arcs admissible, ensuring that the reduced costs of all basic variables (arcs with positive flow) are non-negative. When the algorithm terminates, it has found an optimal solution to the transportation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's prove that only an empty arc can become inadmissible after modification of the dual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an admissible basic arc (i, j) with positive flow (x(i, j) > 0) and reduced cost r(i, j) = 0. If we modify the dual variables, we must ensure that we do not violate the complementary slackness conditions for the basic variables. Therefore, if we increase u(i) by some amount α, we must also increase v(j) by the same amount α to maintain r(i, j) = 0:\n",

    "r(i, j) = c(i, j) - (u(i) + α) - (v(j) + α) = c(i, j) - u(i) - v(j)\n",

    "For non-basic arcs with x(i, j) = 0, increasing u(i) by α and v(j) by α will increase their reduced costs by α, which does not make them inadmissible. However, if we increase u(i) by α and do not adjust v(j), then the reduced cost of arc (i, j) will become negative, making it inadmissible.\n",

    "Here's a proof of Konig's theorem that provides an explanation:\n",

    "    Let G = (A, B, E) be a bipartite graph, where A and B are the disjoint sets of vertices and E is the set of edges between A and B.\n",

    "Now, let's construct the vertex cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define the set X = (A - T) ∪ (B ∩ T). We claim that X is a vertex cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof that X is a vertex cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider any edge e = (u, v) ∈ E, where u ∈ A and v ∈ B. If u ∈ T, then e cannot be part of the maximum matching M, because if it were, there would be an alternating path from R to u. Therefore, v must be in T and thus v ∈ X.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If u ∉ T, then u ∈ A - T and thus u ∈ X. In either case, one of the vertices incident to e is in X, so X is a vertex cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to show that |M| = |X|:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Observe that every vertex in A - T is matched by M, because if any vertex u ∈ A - T were unmatched, it would be in R, which contradicts our definition of A - T.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarly, every vertex in B ∩ T is also matched by M. Suppose there exists a vertex v ∈ B ∩ T that is unmatched. Then, there must be an alternating path P from R to v, which means P ends with an unmatched edge. But that implies we can increase the size of M by augmenting it along P, which contradicts the fact that M is a maximum matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since every vertex in X is matched by M, it follows that |M| ≥ |X|.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since X is a vertex cover, there cannot be more edges in M than there are vertices in X, so |M| ≤ |X|.\n",
